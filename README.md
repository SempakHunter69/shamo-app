## Learning Laravel
This repository contains the materials and projects related to the Laravel learning class that I purchased from BuildWithAngga.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this repository is to track my progress, store the projects I build during the class, and keep all the learning materials organized in one place. By having a centralized repository, I can easily revisit the course content, refer back to the projects, and apply the knowledge gained from the class to future projects.
